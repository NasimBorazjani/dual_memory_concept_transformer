Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir.\n 1974), was a landmark case decided in U.S. federal court that brought an end to the Trusty system and the flagrant inmate abuse that accompanied it at Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman) in Sunflower County, Mississippi.\n It was the first case in a body of law developed in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals holding that a variety of forms of corporal punishment against prisoners constituted cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of Eighth Amendment rights.\n This case was also the first broad-scale intervention by a court in the supervision of prison practices.\n\n[Trusty system (prison)]\nThe \"trustee system\" (sometimes homophonically though perhaps incorrectly called \"trusty system\") was a strict system of discipline and security in the United States made compulsory under Mississippi state law (but also used in other states, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, New York and Texas) as the method of controlling and working inmates at Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, Mississippi's only prison.\n It was designed to replace convict leasing.\n Under this system, designated inmates were used by staff to control and administer physical punishment to other inmates according to a strict prison-determined inmate hierarchy of power.\n The case of \"Gates v. Collier\" (Gates v. Collier Prison Reform Case, 1970–1971) ended the flagrant abuse of inmates under the trusty system and other prison abuses which had continued essentially unchanged since the building of the prison in 1903 in Mississippi.\n Other states using the trusty system were also forced to give it up under this ruling.\n\n[Algerian Six]\nThe Algerian Six are six Bosnian men (five of them citizens with dual nationality), all born in Algeria, who had been imprisoned without charges at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since January 2002.\n They filed for \"habeas\" corpus in United States federal court and their case reached the United States Supreme Court.\n It ruled in \"Boumediene v. Bush\" (2008) that detainees and foreign nationals had rights to file for \"habeas corpus\" in federal courts.\n Following his review of their cases, a US District Court judge ordered five of the Bosnians to be released based on insufficient evidence.\n\n[Hollingsworth v. Perry]\nHollingsworth v. Perry refers to a series of United States federal court cases that legalized same-sex marriage in the State of California.\n The case began in 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which found that banning same-sex marriage violates equal protection under the law.\n This decision overturned ballot initiative Proposition 8, which had banned same-sex marriage.\n After the State of California refused to defend Proposition 8, the official sponsors of Proposition 8 intervened and appealed to the Supreme Court.\n The case was litigated during the governorships of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown, and was thus known as Perry v. Schwarzenegger and Perry v. Brown, respectively.\n As \"Hollingsworth v. Perry\", it eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which held that, in line with prior precedent, the official sponsors of a ballot initiative measure did not have Article III standing to appeal an adverse federal court ruling when the state refused to do so.\n\n[Federal Court of Australia]\nThe Federal Court of Australia is an Australian superior court of record which has jurisdiction to deal with most civil disputes governed by federal law (with the exception of family law matters), along with some summary (less serious) criminal matters.\n Cases are heard at first instance by single Judges.\n The Court includes an appeal division referred to as the Full Court comprising three Judges, the only avenue of appeal from which lies to the High Court of Australia.\n In the Australian court hierarchy, the Federal Court occupies a position equivalent to the Supreme Courts of each of the states and territories.\n In relation to the other Courts in the federal stream, it is equal to the Family Court of Australia, and superior to the Federal Circuit Court.\n It was established in 1976 by the Federal Court of Australia Act.\n\n[Hess v. Reynolds]\nHess v. Reynolds, 113 U.S. 73 (1885) , was Supreme Court case determining whether a probate case from Michigan should be moved to federal court and, if so, which federal court should hear it.\n The court issued a writ of error on the judgment of the Eastern District of Michigan federal court for remanding a case back to the state court but determined that was indeed the appropriate federal court to hear the case.\n\n[Al Odah v. United States]\nAl Odah v. United States is a court case filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights and co-counsels challenging the legality of the continued detention as enemy combatants of Guantanamo detainees.\n It was consolidated with \"Boumediene v. Bush\" (2008), which is the lead name of the decision.\n\n[Military Commissions Act of 2009]\nThe Military Commissions Act of 2009, which amended the Military Commissions Act of 2006, was passed to address concerns by the United States Supreme Court.\n In \"Boumediene v. Bush\" (2008) the court had ruled that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was unconstitutional in suspending the right of detainees to \"habeas corpus\".\n The court ruled that detainees had the right to access US federal courts to challenge their detentions.\n\n[Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co.]\nKlaxon Company v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Company, 313 U.S. 487 (1941) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court applied the choice-of-law principles of \"Erie Railroad v. Tompkins\" to conflicts between laws of different states for cases sitting in federal court on diversity jurisdiction.\n The court held that a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice-of-law doctrine of the forum state to choose between the forum state's law and the other state's law (as distinguished from the federal choice-of-law doctrines which had been used before \"Erie\").\n\nQuestion: Were Gates v. Collier and Boumediene v. Bush both cases in the federal court ?\nAnswer: no\n"}

Gran Fondos are officially defined and certified by the Italian Cycling Federation as a bicycle event at least 120 km (75 miles) long, and is an individually chip-timed (start to finish) race with prizes for the fastest riders in each category.\n The starts are done en masse, and the format allows for riders of every level to participate, much like a marathon, where most participants are competing against the clock instead of other participants.\n Traditionally a large meal is served to the participants at the end of the event, and roads are shut down.\n Nowadays only a handful of the largest Italian Gran Fondos have full road closures, but laws requiring riders to obey all traffic signals are more lax in Italy compared to the US.\n Recently this format of biking has reached the US, and has exploded in popularity.\n The first few US Gran Fondo events were organized in 2009.\n Now, in 2017, there are over 200+ events in North America.\n There is no official authority to certify US Grand Fondos.\n As a result, they come in many different varieties with some adhering very strictly to the traditional definition (often going as far as to have a full road closure), and others treating it more like a century ride where riders only compete in short timed sections and enjoy a large elaborate banquet at the finish.\n\n[Battle of Tarqui]\nThe Battle of Tarqui, also known

{"text": "[Tree fern]\nThe tree ferns are the ferns that grow with a trunk elevating the fronds above ground level.\n Most tree ferns are members of the \"core tree ferns\", belonging to the families Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae in the order Cyatheales.\n In addition to those families, many ferns in other groups may be considered tree ferns, such as several ferns in the family Osmundaceae, which can achieve short trunks under a metre tall, and particularly ferns in the genus \"Cibotium\", which can grow ten metres tall.\n Fern species with short trunks in the genera \"Blechnum, Calochleana, Cnemedaria, Culcita\" (Europe's only tree fern), \"Cystodium, Leptopteris, Lophosoria, Sadleria, Thyrsopteris\" and \"Todea\" could also be considered tree ferns in a liberal interpretation of the term.\n\n[Frond dimorphism]\nFrond dimorphism refers to a difference in ferns between the fertile and sterile fronds.\n Since ferns, unlike flowering plants, bear spores on the leaf blade itself, this may affect the form of the frond itself.\n In some species of ferns, there is virtually no difference between the fertile and sterile fronds, such as in the genus \"Dryopteris\", other than the mere presence of the sori, or fruit-dots, on the back of the fronds.\n Some other species, such as \"Polystichum acrostichoides\" (Christmas fern), or some ferns of the genus \"Osmunda\", feature dimorphism on a portion of the frond only.\n Others, such as some species of \"Blechnum\" and \"Woodwardia\", have fertile fronds that are markedly taller than the sterile.\n Still others, such as \"Osmunda cinnamomea\" (Cinnamon fern), or plants of the family Onocleaceae, have fertile fronds that are completely different from the sterile.\n\n[Polypodium]\nPolypodium is a genus of 75–100 species of true ferns, widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics.\n The name is derived from Ancient Greek \"poly\" (πολύ) \"many\" + \"podion\" (πόδιον) \"little foot\", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches.\n They are commonly called polypody or rockcap fern, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.\n\n[Leptosporangiate fern]\nLeptosporangiate ferns are the largest group of living ferns, including some 11000 species worldwide.\n They constitute the subclass Polypodiidae, but are often considered to be the class Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida, although other classifications assign them a different rank.\n The leptosporangiate ferns are one of the four major groups of ferns, with the other three being the Eusporangiate ferns comprising the marattioid ferns (Marattiidae, Marattiaceae), the horsetails (Equisetiidae, Equisetaceae), and whisk ferns and moonworts.\n\n[Mukdenia]\nMukdenia is a genus of plants in the saxifrage family, Saxifragaceae, consisting of 2 species.\n They are native to woodland areas of east Asia and Japan.\n\n[Polypodium appalachianum]\nPolypodium appalachianum is a fern species native to eastern North America.\n Sometimes called the Appalachian polypody or Appalachian rockcap fern, it is very similar in appearance to \"Polypodium virginianum\".\n For years, \"P. virginianum\" -- long considered a variety of the British \"Polypodium vulgare\" -- was recognized as having cryptic races, with diploid, triploid, and tetraploid representatives.\n Since the triploid specimens bore abortive spores, it was apparently the hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid groups.\n In 1991, it was resolved that the type of \"P. virginianum\" was the tetraploid series, and that it is an allotetraploid species of hybrid origin, with the diploid species as one parent.\n The diploid species was then named \"P. appalachianum\".\n The other parent of \"P. virginianum\" was found to be \"Polypodium sibiricum\".\n The tetraploid of hybrid derivation tolerates warmer climates than either parent.\n\n[Clostridium tetani]\nClostridium tetani is a rod-shaped, anaerobic species of pathogenic bacteria, of the genus \"Clostridium\".\n Like other \"Clostridium\" genus species, it is Gram-positive, and its appearance on a gram stain resembles tennis rackets or drumsticks.\n \"C. tetani\" is found as spores in soil or in the gastrointestinal tract of animals.\n \"C. tetani\" produces a potent biological toxin, tetanospasmin, and is the causative agent of tetanus, a disease characterized by painful muscular spasms that can lead to respiratory failure and, in up to 10% of cases, death.\n\n[Tatrasuchus]\nTatrasuchus is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian from the Middle Triassic of Poland.\n It is classified as a member of the family Cyclotosauridae or Mastodonsauridae.\n It is closely related to the genus \"Cyclotosaurus\".\n The type species, \"Tatrasuchus kulczyckii\", was named in 1996.\n Damiani (2001) considered genus \"Kupferzellia\" Schoch (1997) from Middle Triassic of Germany to be a junior synonym of \"Tatrasuchus\", and recombined its type species, \"K. wildi\" as the second species of \"Tatrasuchus\".\n This classification was followed by some authors, e.g. Fortuny \"et al.\" (2011); other authors, e.g. Schoch (2008), maintain \"Tatrasuchus\" and \"Kupferzellia\" as distinct genera.\n\n[Phlebodium]\nPhlebodium is a small genus of two to four species of ferns, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.\n The genus is closely related to \"Polypodium\", and the species were formerly included in that genus.\n\n[Lophosoria quadripinnata]\nLophosoria quadripinnata is a species of fern that, according to DNA molecular analysis, belongs to the Dicksoniaceae family, where it is placed in the genus \"Lophosoria\".\n It is found in the Americas spanning from Cuba and Mexico to Chile.\n In Chile it is present in the area between Talca and Aysén including Juan Fernández Islands.\n In Argentina it grows only in the humid valleys of western Neuquén and Río Negro Province.\n Diamondleaf fern is a common name.\n In Spanish it is known as 'ampe' (from the Mapudungun añpe) or palmilla, but one has to remember that there are several species of ferns called \"palmillas\" that have larger or smaller fronds, and which grow in colder climates.\n It is a medium-sized plant, growing to about 4–5 feet (though 10–12 feet in a sheltered place at Arduaine Garden in Argyll, Scotland) and even though the rhizome does not grow a trunk, it is clearly related to the other tree ferns due to features that were apparently already present in their common ancestor, like 'pneumathodes', and the rhizome which changed from the dorsiventral symmetry typical of the other ferns, to a radial symmetry typical of tree ferns.\n Their large and multiple pinnate fronds, with the petiole raised adaxially, and the hairs on the rhizome and lower part of the petioles, also resemble those of tree ferns.\n To identify the species, use the position and characteristics of the spores found on the fertile fronds.\n The genus already existed in the Cretaceous Period in southern Gondwana according to fossil remains found in Antarctica.\n The species is well known as an ornamental plant.\n\nQuestion: Are both Polypodium and Mukdenia considered genus species of ferns?\nAnswer: no\n"}

Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.\n Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.\n Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.\n Thus the birth of Modifications.\n It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.\n FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.\n Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.\n Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.\n Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.\n Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.\n During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.\n The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.\n During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.\n Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.\n The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.\n that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.\n Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.\n This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.\n The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.\n The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.\n Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.\n Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.\n Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.\n Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.\n While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.\n The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.\n It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.\n Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.\n Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.\n Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\n[Casino Jack and the United States of Money]\nCasino Jack and the United States of Money is a 2010 documentary film directed by Alex Gibney.\n\n[Treasury Note (19th century)]\nA Treasury Note is a type of short term debt instrument issued by the United States prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.\n Without the alternatives offered by a federal paper money or a central bank, the U.S. government relied on these instruments for funding during periods of financial stress such as the War of 1812, the Panic of 1837, and the American Civil War.\n While the Treasury Notes, as issued, were neither legal tender nor representative money, some issues were used as money in lieu of an official federal paper money.\n However the motivation behind their issuance was always funding federal expenditures rather than the provision of a circulating medium.\n These notes typically were hand-signed, of large denomination (at least $50), of large dimension (bigger than private banknotes), bore interest, were payable to the order of the owner (whose name was written on the front of the note), and matured in no more than three years - though some issues lacked one or more of these properties.\n Often they were receivable at face value by the government in payment of taxes and for purchases of publicly owned land, and thus \"might to some extent be regarded as paper money.\"\n On many issues the interest rate was chosen to make interest calculations particularly easy, paying either 1, 1½, or 2 cents per day on a $100 note.\n\n[Fly Farm Blues]\n\"Fly Farm Blues\" is a song by rock musician Jack White.\n The song was written

Walters]\nBoard of Education v. Walters was a 1979 Ohio Supreme Court case relating to the funding of primary and secondary schools in Ohio.\n The Court ruled that the method of funding public schools at the time was constitutional despite disparities in per-pupil education spending between different districts.\n Article VI of the Ohio Constitution states that the state must provide an \"adequate system of public schools.\"\n The ruling overturned a previous trial court ruling that the State's school-funding system violated the Constitution of Ohio's requirement of providing a thorough and efficient system of public education.\n \"Board of Education v. Walters\" is one of the cases that played a role leading to \"DeRolph v. State of Ohio\" in 1997, which found the model of funding for public schools in Ohio to be unconstitutional.\n\n[Charter School (Massachusetts)]\nCharter schools operate with considerably more independence than traditional public schools.\n However, Massachusetts has two kinds of charter schools - Commonwealth Charters and Horace Mann Charters.\n Horace Mann charter schools differ from Commonwealth charter schools as they must be located within a school district.\n Both kinds of charter schools are free to structure their curriculum and school environment; for instance, many charter schools fit more instructional hours into a year by running longer school days and providing instruction on weekends and during the summer.\n Because few charter schools are unionized, they can hire and fire teachers and administrative staff without regard to the collectively bargained seniority and tenure provisions that constrain such decisions in most public schools.\n Although charter students made up only 2.9 percent of U.S. public school enrollment in 2008–2009, charter enrollment has grown rapidly and seems likely to accelerate in the near future.\n The growth of charter schools is an important component of the contemporary education reform movement's pursuit of accountability and flexibility in public education.\n Proponents see charter schools' freedom from regulation as a source of educational innovation, with the added benefit of providing a source of competition that may prompt innovation and improvement in the rest of the public system.\n At the same time, charter schools are controversial because, after a transition period in which the state provides subsidies, they receive a tuition payment for each enrolled student paid by students' home districts.\n In Massachusetts, tuition payments are determined largely by the average per-pupil expenditure in sending districts.\n Not surprisingly, therefore, public school districts are concerned about the revenue lost when their students enroll in charter schools.\n\n[Independent school (United Kingdom)]\nIn the United Kingdom, independent schools (also private schools) are fee-paying private schools, governed by an elected board of governors and independent of many of the regulations and conditions that apply to state-funded schools.\n For example, pupils do not have to follow the National Curriculum.\n Many of the older, expensive and more exclusive schools catering for the 13–18 age-range in England and Wales are known as public schools as defined by the Public Schools Act 1868.\n The term \"public\" being derived from the fact that they were open to pupils regardless of where they lived or their religion (while in many other countries a public school is run by the state or municipality.)\n.\n Prep schools, (or preparatory school) educate younger children up to the age of 13 to \"prepare\" them for entry to the public schools and other independent schools.\n Some former grammar schools converted to an independent fee paying model following the 1965 Circular 10/65 which marked the end of their state funding, others converted into comprehensive schools.\n\nQuestion: Are the University of Mumbai and University of Texas at Dallas both state/public schools?\nAnswer: yes\n"}

\"Sisterhood is Powerful\" in a flier she wrote for the keynote speech she gave for New York Radical Women's first public action at the convocation of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, was one of four women who held the Women's Liberation banner at the Miss America protest, and had her paper \"A Program for Radical Feminist Consciousness-Raising\" presented at the First National Women's Liberation Conference outside Chicago on November 27, 1968 (it was later published in \"Notes from the Second Year\" in 1970.)\n She was a member of New York Radical Women.\n In February 1969 she led Redstockings in their disruption of the New York State Abortion Reform Hearing, at which women first demanded to testify about their own abortions.)\n\n[New Directions for Women]\nNew Directions for Women was an important early feminist newspaper.\n It began as a mimeographed newsletter in 1972 in New Jersey, but soon expanded into a tabloid-sized quarterly newspaper.\n Edited by Paula Kassell of Dover, a member of the Morristown chapter of National Organization for Women (NOW), the paper offered news reports from a feminist perspective as well as book reviews, women's history articles, and editorials, and was the first national feminist newspaper in the United States.\n After years of struggling to attain financial stability, the newspaper discontinued publishing in 1993.\n This was five years before Pamela Wilder founded the non-profit drug rehab \"New Directions for Women\" in 1977 through the Junior League of Orange County.\n New Directions for Women is still helping women, pregnant women, and their children find recovery.\n\n[Digital edition]\nA digital edition is an online magazine or online newspaper delivered in electronic form which is formatted identically to the print version.\n Digital editions are often called digital facsimiles to underline the likeness to the print version.\n Digital editions have the benefit of reduced cost to the publisher and reader by avoiding the time and expense to print and deliver like a paper edition.\n This format is considered more environmentally friendly due to the reduction of paper and energy use.\n These editions also often feature interactive elements such as hyperlinks both within the publication itself and to other internet resources, searching and bookmarking, and can also incorporate multimedia such as video or animation to enhance articles themselves or for advertisements.\n Some delivery methods also include animation and sound effects replicating page turning to further enhance the experience of their print counterparts.Traditionally, magazine publishers have relied on two revenue sources: selling ads and selling magazines.\n Additionally some publishers are using other electronic publication methods such as RSS to reach out to readers and inform them when new digital editions are available.\n\n[Woman's World]\nWoman's World is an American supermarket weekly magazine with a circulation of 1.6 million readers.\n Printed on paper generally associated with tabloid publications and priced accordingly, it concentrates on short articles about subjects such as weight loss, relationship advice

by Hugo Gernsback for seven issues in 1953.\n In 1926 Gernsback had launched \"Amazing Stories,\" the first science fiction magazine, but he had not been involved in the genre since 1936, when he sold \"Wonder Stories\".\n \"Science-Fiction Plus\" was initially in slick format, meaning that it was large-size and printed on glossy paper.\n Gernsback had always believed in the educational power of science fiction, and he continued to advocate his views in the new magazine's editorials.\n The managing editor, Sam Moskowitz, had been a reader of the early pulp magazines, and published many writers who had been popular before World War II, such as Raymond Gallun, Eando Binder, and Harry Bates.\n Combined with Gernsback's earnest editorials, the use of these early writers gave the magazine an anachronistic feel.\n Sales were initially good, but soon fell.\n For the last two issues Gernsback switched the magazine to cheaper pulp paper, but the magazine remained unprofitable.\n The final issue was dated December 1953.\n\n[Whit Burnett]\nWhit Burnett (1900–1972) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine \"Story\".\n In the 1940s, \"Story\" was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors.\n Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but \"Story\" remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like \"Collier's\" or \"The Saturday Evening Post\" or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as \"The New Yorker\".\n While \"Story\" paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest-sized magazines of its day, it paid better than most of, and had similar cachet to, the university-based and the other independent \"little magazines\" of its era.\n\n[Joy Press]\nJoy Press (born 1966) is a writer and editor.\n In the 1980s she was a music critic for American magazines and for the English weekly music paper \"Melody Maker\".\n In 1996 she

Gillings, who was not credited.\n Technically these were anthologies, not magazines: Postwar paper shortages meant that new magazines could only be launched after an application process that did not apply to anthologies, so the publisher treated them as anthologies.\n Its writers included Jack Williamson, Robert Bloch, and Ray Bradbury.\n The issues, which were not dated, appeared in February and March 1946.\n They were both 64 pages long; the first was priced at 1/-; the second at 9d.\n\n[Peg's Paper]\nPeg's Paper was a weekly British women's magazine, published from 1919 to 1940 in about

photostories of movie stars, as well as other features including fortune-telling and a letters page.\n Its advertising concentrated on looks.\n It was the parent paper of \"Peg's Companion\", which launched in 1921 and had two fictional stories in each issue.\n Richard Hoggart considered \"Peg's Paper\" an example of working-class art whose \"overriding interest is in the close detail of the human condition\", using it as an example of such in his book \"The Uses of Literacy\".\n\nQuestion: Are New! and Peg's Paper both women's magazines?\nAnswer: no\n"}

single, \"Boiling\", and one music video for \"Control\", \"The Face\" garnered critical acclaim, major praises being towards the quality of the EP's musical style and song structures.\n\n[Otello (Rossini)]\nThe opera deviates heavily from Shakespeare's version not only in that it takes place in Venice and not on Cyprus, but also in that the whole dramatic conflict develops in a different manner.\n The role of Iago is reduced to some degree, and it is much less diabolical than in the original or in Verdi's \"Otello\" of 1887.\n In further contrast, the role of Rodrigo, of subsidiary importance in Shakespeare and Verdi, is very prominent in Rossini's version and is assigned some of the most difficult and brilliant music.\n The roles of Otello, Iago, and Rodrigo are all composed for the tenor voice.\n\n[Akhnaten (opera)]\nAkhnaten is an opera in three acts based on the life and religious convictions of the pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV), written by the American minimalist

{"text": "[Fox Terrier]\nFox Terriers are two different breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier.\n Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century from a handful of dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds.\n In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier.\n The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings.\n They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland.\n\n[Kerry Blue Terrier]\nThe Kerry Blue Terrier (also known as the Irish Blue Terrier) () is a breed of dog.\n Originally bred to control \"vermin\" including rats, rabbits, badgers, foxes, otters and hares, over time the Kerry became a general working dog used for a variety of jobs including herding cattle and sheep, and as a guard dog.\n Today the Kerry has spread around the world as a companion and working dog.\n Despite a Kerry Blue winning Crufts (the most important UK dog show) in 2000, it remains an \"unfashionable\" breed, and is distinctly uncommon; however, it not as threatened as some of the other terrier breeds such as Skye Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier.\n\n[Paisley Terrier]\nThe Paisley Terrier was a breed of terrier type dog that is now extinct.\n Originating in Scotland, the Paisley Terrier was bred primarily as a pet and showdog version of the Skye Terrier, and was the progenitor of today's Yorkshire Terrier.\n The breed was called the Paisley terrier since most of the dogs came from that location, but it was also called the Clydesdale Terrier, for another location in the Clyde Valley where the dogs were bred.\n\n[Terrier Group]\nTerrier Group is the name of a breed Group of dogs, used by kennel clubs to classify a defined collection of dog breeds.\n In general, a \"Terrier Group\" includes one particular type of dog, the Terrier, although other types may be included in a kennel club's \"Terrier Group\".\n Most major English-language kennel clubs include a \"Terrier Group\" although different kennel clubs may not include the same breeds in their \"Terrier Group\".\n The international kennel club association, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, includes Terriers in Group 3 \"Terrier\", which is then further broken down into four \"Sections\" based on the type of terrier and breed history.\n\n[Hunt terrier]\nHunt Terrier (not \"hunting terrier\") refers to types of terrier dogs that were attached to British \"hunts\", horse-oriented social clubs devoted to chasing the red fox on horseback, following packs of hounds.\n The hunt terrier was kept for a variety of reasons, such as rat control around stables and kennels, and to run with the hounds to flush the fox from small hiding places.\n It might also be expected to flush foxes from underground dens (\"going to earth\" like a working terrier), or to act as a lurcher.\n They tended to be white in colour so as to be more easily seen by the hunter, but they could be any colour.\n\n[Pit bull]\nPit bull is the common name for a type of dog.\n Formal breeds often considered in North America to be of the pit bull type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n The American Bulldog is also sometimes included.\n Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from cross breeding bull-baiting dogs (used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls) and terriers.\n After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned, such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt and drive livestock, and as family companions.\n Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States, it still exists as an underground activity, and pit bulls are a common breed of choice.\n\n[Rafeiro do Alentejo]\nThe Rafeiro do Alentejo or

area of origin, Alentejo, in south-central Portugal.\n Although the word \"rafeiro\" means \"mongrel\" in Portuguese, the Rafeiro do Alentejo is recognized as a breed by the Portuguese Caniculture

Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.\n There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.\n It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.\n Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.\n It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.\n These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.\n Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.\n Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.\n\n[Russkiy Toy]\nThe Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: Русский той, Тойчик ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier.\n There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.\n The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.\n Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the

Heublein and Bro.\n upon its transfer to Andrew's sons Gilbert and Louis Heublein in 1890, when the focus was turning towards their lucrative line of \"ready-made\" alcoholic cocktail drinks.\n In 1906 the business gained the rights to distribute (and later produce) A1 Steak Sauce for the US market, under license from Brand & Co.

{"text": "[Pleiacanthus]\nPleiacanthus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the aster family containing the single species Pleiacanthus spinosus (formerly \"Stephanomeria spinosa\"), which is known by the common name thorn skeletonweed, or thorny skeletonweed.\n It is native to the western United States from Montana and Idaho to southern California and Arizona, where it grows in many types of mostly dry habitat from deserts to mountains.\n It is a spindly subshrub producing several slender stems up to 40 or 50 centimeters tall from a woody caudex.\n The stems divide many times into short, rigid branches which narrow to sharp thorn-tips.\n The plant is mostly hairless except for brownish woolly tufts at the base and below the basal leaves.\n The leaves are small and linear on the lower stem, and reduced to scale-like growths on the upper branches.\n Flower heads occur near the ends of the branches.\n Each has a cylindrical base wrapped in one layer of phyllaries.\n The head contains 3 to 5 ray florets, each with an elongated tube and a pale to bright pink ligule.\n The fruit is an achene tipped with a cluster of pappus bristles which are not plumelike as are those of the \"Stephanomeria\" species with which this plant was once classified.\n\n[Tuberaria]\nTuberaria is a genus of about 12 species of annual or perennial plants in the rockrose family Cistaceae, native to western and southern Europe.\n They occur on dry, stony sites, often close to the sea.\n\n[Carphalea]\nCarphalea is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family.\n It is endemic to Madagascar.\n\n[Self-pollination]\nSelf-pollination is when pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of a flower (in flowering plants) or at the ovule (in Gymnosperms).\n There are two types of self-pollination: In autogamy, pollen is transferred to the stigma of the same flower.\n In geitonogamy, pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the same flowering plant, or from microsporangium to ovule within a single (monoecious) Gymnosperm.\n Some plants have mechanisms that ensure autogamy, such as flowers that do not open (cleistogamy), or stamens that move to come into contact with the stigma.\n The term selfing that is often used as a synonym, is not limited to self-pollination, but also applies to other types of self fertilization.\n\n[Exochorda]\nExochorda is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to China and central Asia (Turkestan).\n They are used as ornamental plants with the common name pearl bush, or pearlbush.\n Numerous species have been described on the basis of differing appearance and geographical separation, but a systematic study revealed that the different types are closely related and probably all descended from a single species that formerly had a wide distribution that has been fragmented by habitat loss.\n As a single species the correct name is \"E. racemosa\".\n\n[Tessmannianthus]\nTessmannianthus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae.\n There are seven species distributed in Central and South America.\n They are medium to large trees up to 40 meters tall.\n The flowers are heterantherous, bearing two types of stamens.\n These plants are rare, and some are narrow endemics known from only one location.\n\n[Vigna]\nVigna is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution.\n It includes some well-known cultivated species, including many types of beans.\n Some are former members of the genus \"Phaseolus\".\n According to \"Hortus Third\", \"Vigna\" differs from \"Phaseolus\" in biochemistry and pollen structure, and in details of the style and stipules.\n\n[Mentzelia affinis]\nMentzelia affinis is a species of flowering plants in the family Loasaceae known by the common name yellowcomet.\n It is native to the southern half of California, Arizona, and adjacent sections of Nevada and Baja California, where it is known from scrub, woodland, desert sands, and other habitat types.\n\n[Vessel element]\nA vessel element or vessel member (trachea) is one of the cell types found in xylem, the water conducting tissue of plants.\n Vessel elements (tracheae) are typically found in flowering plants (angiosperms) but absent from most gymnosperms such as conifers.\n Vessel elements are the main feature distinguishing the \"hardwood\" of angiosperms from the \"softwood\" of conifers.\n\n[Gonochorism]\nIn biology, gonochorism (\"Greek\" offspring + disperse) or unisexualism or gonochory describes the state of having just one of at least two distinct sexes in any one individual organism.\n The term is most often used with animals, in which the individual organisms are often gonochorous.\n Gonochory is less common in plants.\n For example, in flowering plants, individual flowers may be hermaphrodite (i.e. with both stamens and ovaries) or gonochorous (unisexual), having either no stamens (i.e. no male parts) or no ovaries (i.e. no female parts).\n Among flowering plant species that have unisexual flowers, some also produce hermaphrodite flowers, and the three types occur in different arrangements on separate plants; the plants can be monoecious, dioecious, polygamomonoecious, polygamodioecious, andromonoecious, or gynomonoecious.\n\nQuestion: Tuberaria and Carphalea, are both types of flowering plants?\nAnswer: no\n"}

MTS boundaries are defined by virtue of the fact that all teams within the system, while pursuing different proximal goals, share at least one common distal goal; and in doing so, exhibit input, process and outcome interdependence with at least one other team in the system\" (Mathieu, Marks, & Zaccaro, 2001, pp. 290).\n Multiteam systems describe collections of teams that work toward a common goal.\n MTSs are often conceptualized as larger than a single team, but smaller than the organization within which they are embedded (Mathieu, et al., 2001).\n In fact, MTSs often traverse organizations such that teams embedded within the same MTS may hail from multiple organizations.\n These systems of teams can be conceptualized as a special type of social network (Wasserman & Faust, 1994).\n In particular, MTSs are social networks whose boundaries are based on the shared interdependence of all members toward the accomplishment of a higher-order network-level goal.\n Multiteam systems are different from teams, because they are composed of multiple teams (called component teams) that must coordinate and collaborate.\n In MTSs, component teams each pursue proximal team goals (not shared with other teams in the system) and at the same time, work toward the larger system level goal.\n Because of this dual focus on team goals and systems goals, there are many situations where interventions aimed at improving the internal cohesion of teams will come at a cost to the larger goal.\n The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in the social sciences in understanding multiteam systems.\n MTSs are thought to explain the dynamics that arise in the public sector such as Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and in the private sector with strategic alliances.\n\n[Joe Orton]\nJohn Kingsley \"Joe\" Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967) was an English playwright and author.\n His public career was short but prolific, lasting from 1964 until his death three years later.\n During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies.\n The adjective \"Ortonesque\" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.\n\n[The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown]\n\"The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown\" is a short story by Damon Runyon telling of the improbable – but eventually triumphant – love between an inveterate gambler (Sky Masterson) and a missionary girl (the Miss Sarah Brown of the title).\n It was the basis for the musical \"Guys and Dolls\" – with a similar plot line, but with many additional twists and turns added before the lovers are finally reunited and live happily ever after.\n It was first published in 1933.\n In 1949, it was dramatized on radio as part of a program called \"Damon Runyon Theatre\".\n\nQuestion: Did both Joe Orton and Damon Runyon work toward advancement of literacy?\nAnswer: yes\n"}

{"text": "[Plant tolerance to herbivory]\nTolerance is the ability of plants to mitigate the negative fitness effects caused by herbivory.\n It is one of the general plant defense strategies against herbivores, the other being resistance, which is the ability of plants to prevent damage (Strauss and Agrawal 1999).\n Plant defense strategies play important roles in the survival of plants as they are fed upon by many different types of herbivores, especially insects, which may impose negative fitness effects (Strauss and Zangerl 2002).\n Damage can occur in almost any part of the plants, including the roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds (Strauss and Zergerl 2002).\n In response to herbivory, plants have evolved a wide variety of defense mechanisms and although relatively less studied than resistance strategies, tolerance traits play a major role in plant defense (Strauss and Zergerl 2002, Rosenthal and Kotanen 1995).\n\n[Silene menziesii]\nSilene menziesii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Menzies' campion and Menzies' catchfly.\n It is native to western North America from Alaska through the western half of Canada to the southwestern United States.\n It can be found in many types of habitat and it is quite common in much of its range.\n It is variable in morphology and there are a number of varied subtaxa.\n In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex, appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long.\n It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs.\n The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower.\n Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both.\n Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals.\n The petals are white with two lobes at the tips.\n The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers.\n The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male.\n\n[Gonochorism]\nIn biology, gonochorism (\"Greek\" offspring + disperse) or unisexualism or gonochory describes the state of having just one of at least two distinct sexes in any one individual organism.\n The term is most often used with animals, in which the individual organisms are often gonochorous.\n Gonochory is less common in plants.\n For example, in flowering plants, individual flowers may be hermaphrodite (i.e. with both stamens and ovaries) or gonochorous (unisexual), having either no stamens (i.e. no male parts) or no ovaries (i.e. no female parts).\n Among flowering plant species that have unisexual flowers, some also produce hermaphrodite flowers, and the three types occur in different arrangements on separate plants; the plants can be monoecious, dioecious, polygamomonoecious, polygamodioecious, andromonoecious, or gynomonoecious.\n\n[Emilia (plant)]\nEmilia is a genus of herbaceous plants in the family sunflower family, known as tasselflower or pualele.\n\n[List of power stations in Nigeria]\nThere are currently two main types of power plants operating in Nigeria: (1) hydro-electric and (2) thermal or fossil fuel power plants.\n With a total installed capacity of 8457.6MW (81 percent of total) in early 2014, thermal power plants (gas-fired plants) dominates the Nigerian power supply mix.\n Electricity production from hydroelectric sources (% of total) in Nigeria was reported at 17.59 % in 2014, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources.\n There have been two main types of fossil fuel/thermal power plants in the country: (i) coal-fired and (ii) natural gas-fired.\n\n[Trellis (architecture)]\nA trellis (treillage) is an architectural structure, usually made from an open framework or lattice of interwoven or intersecting pieces of wood, bamboo or metal that is normally made to support and display climbing plants, especially shrubs.\n There are many types of trellis for different places and for different plants, from agricultural types, especially in viticulture, which are covered at vine training systems, to garden uses for climbers such as grapevines, clematis, ivy, and climbing roses or other support based growing plants.\n The rose trellis is especially common in Europe and other rose-growing areas, and many climbing rose varieties require a trellis to reach their potential as garden plants.\n Some plants will climb and wrap themselves round a trellis without much artificial help being needed while others need training by passing the growing shoots through the trellis and/or tying them to the framework.\n\n[Parrotiopsis]\nParrotiopsis is a genus of deciduous shrub or small tree in the witch hazel family.\n\n[Concrete plant]\nA concrete plant, also known as a batch plant or batching plant or a concrete batching plant, is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete.\n Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement.\n There are two main types of concrete plants: \"Dry mix\" plants and \"Wet mix\" plants, and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a central mix side while utilizing common material storage points.\n A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either \"tilt drum\" or \"horizontal\" or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, batch plant controls, and dust collectors.\n\n[False vivipary]\nFalse vivipary is an abnormal condition found in many types of plants in which a plantlet is produced where the flower should appear.\n It is not a completely understood topic, but some say it could be caused by a hormonal mistake.\n The plantlet which appears can be rooted and grown like normal plants.\n This abnormal behavior can occasionally be seen in many types of carnivorous plants.\n\n[Self-pollination]\nSelf-pollination is when pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of a flower (in flowering plants) or at the ovule (in Gymnosperms).\n There are two types of self-pollination: In autogamy, pollen is transferred to the stigma of the same flower.\n In geitonogamy, pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the same flowering plant, or from microsporangium to ovule within a single (monoecious) Gymnosperm.\n Some plants have mechanisms that ensure autogamy, such as flowers that do not open (cleistogamy), or stamens that move to come into contact with the stigma.\n The term selfing that is often used as a synonym, is not limited to self-pollination, but also applies to other types of self fertilization.\n\nQuestion: Are Parrotiopsis and Emilia both types of plants?\nAnswer: yes\n"}

{"text": "[Carduus]\nCarduus is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae, and the tribe Cynareae, one of two genera considered to be true thistles, the other being \"Cirsium\".\n Plants of the genus are known commonly as plumeless thistles.\n They are native to Eurasia and Africa, and several are known elsewhere as introduced species.\n This genus is noted for its disproportionately high number of noxious weeds compared to other flowering plant genera.\n\n[Eudicots]\nThe eudicots, Eudicotidae or eudicotyledons are a monophyletic clade of flowering plants that had been called tricolpates or non-magnoliid dicots by previous authors.\n The botanical terms were introduced in 1991 by evolutionary botanist James A. Doyle and paleobotanist Carol L. Hotton to emphasize the later evolutionary divergence of tricolpate dicots from earlier, less specialized, dicots.\n The close relationships among flowering plants with tricolpate pollen grains was initially seen in morphological studies of shared derived characters.\n These plants have a distinct trait in their pollen grains of exhibiting three colpi or grooves paralleling the polar axis.\n Later molecular evidence confirmed the genetic basis for the evolutionary relationships among flowering plants with tricolpate pollen grains and dicotyledonous traits.\n The term means \"true dicotyledons\", as it contains the majority of plants that have been considered dicots and have characteristics of the dicots.\n The term \"eudicots\" has subsequently been widely adopted in botany to refer to one of the two largest clades of angiosperms (constituting over 70% of the angiosperm species), monocots being the other.\n The remaining angiosperms include magnoliids and what are sometimes referred to as basal angiosperms or paleodicots, but these terms have not been widely or consistently adopted, as they do not refer to a monophyletic group.\n\n[Ravenala]\nRavenala is a genus of flowering plants with a single species, Ravenala madagascariensis, commonly known as traveller's tree or traveller's palm, from Madagascar.\n It is not a true palm (family Arecaceae) but a member of a monocotyledonous flowering plant family, Strelitziaceae.\n The genus is closely related to the southern African genus \"Strelitzia\" and the South American genus \"Phenakospermum\".\n Some older classifications include these genera in the banana family (Musaceae).\n Although it is usually considered to be a single species, four different forms have been distinguished.\n\n[Dietes]\nDietes is a genus of rhizomatous plants of the family Iridaceae, first described as a genus in 1866.\n Common names include wood iris, Fortnight lily, African iris, Japanese iris and Butterfly iris, each of which may be used differently in different regions for one or more of the six species within the genus.\n\n[Lloydieae]\nThe Lloydieae were a tribe of monocotyledon perennial, herbaceous mainly bulbous flowering plants in the Liliaceae (Lily) family.\n The tribe was generally considered monogeric, being represented by the single genus \"Lloydia\".\n But since that genus has at various times and is now considered to be part of the genus \"Gagea\", and therefore in the \"Lilieae\" tribe, it was sometimes listed with both genera.\n Furthermore many authorities place \"Gagea\" into a separate tribe, Tulipeae.\n It has also historically been considered to be a subtribe of the Lilieae.\n In 2013, Kim \"et al.\" proposed splitting off \"Gagea\" from the rest of Tulipeae by resurrecting the tribe Lloydieae.\n\n[Horkelia]\nHorkelia is a genus of plants in the rose family.\n It includes several species of plants known commonly as horkelias.\n These are flowering plants closely related to the cinquefoils (\"Potentilla\") and sometimes considered part of the same genus.\n There are nineteen species found in western North America, especially California.\n \"Horkelia\" was named for German scientist Johann Horkel.\n\n[Azorina]\nAzorina is a monotypic genus of flowering plants within the family Campanulaceae, whose sole species, the Azorina vidalii, is endemic to the Azores.\n Its fragmented population is made up of fewer than 1000 mature plants limited to the coastlines of several of the islands.\n\n[Anthecology]\nAnthecology, or pollination biology, is the study of pollination as well as the relationships between flowers and their pollinators.\n Floral biology is a bigger field that includes these studies.\n Most flowering plants, or angiosperms, are pollinated by animals, and especially by insects.\n The major flower-frequenting insect taxa include beetles, flies, wasps, bees, ants, thrips, butterflies, and moths.\n Insects carry out pollination when visiting flowers to obtain nectar or pollen, to prey on other species, or when pseudo-copulating with insect-mimicking flowers such as orchids.\n Pollination-related interactions between plants and insects are considered mutualistic, and the relationships between plants and their pollinators have likely led to increased diversity of both angiosperms and the animals that pollinate them.\n\n[Trilliaceae]\nTrilliaceae is the botanical name of a family of flowering plants.\n The family has been recognised as distinct since 1846 when it was recognized; this table  for a summarizes the placement of these taxa.\n The family has been recognized by taxonomists such as Takhtajan, Dahlgren, Thorne, and Watson & Dallwitz; other taxonomists have considered these plants to belong to the family Liliaceae.\n The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does not recognize such a family either and assigns the plants involved to family Melanthiaceae.\n One problem with this recognition is the lack of morphological synapomorphies for the family Melanthiaceae;

Vogel et al. 1984; Olesen 1985; Valido et al. 2004).\n However more recent work has shown that these plants are adequately pollinated by non-specialist flower visiting birds, particularly the Canary Islands chiffchaff (\"Phylloscopus canariensis\") and the Canary Island spectacled warbler (\"Sylvia conspicillata orbitalis\") (Olesen 1985; Ollerton et al. 2008), and in fact show some specific adaptations to infrequent pollination by these birds, such as extended flower lifespans (Ollerton et al. 2008), and a hexose-dominated sugar ratio of the nectar (Dupont et al. 2004).\n\nQuestion: Are both Dietes and Azorina considered flowering plants?\nAnswer: no\n"}

{"text": "[Ashikaga Yoshinori]\nAshikaga Yoshinori (足利 義教 , July 12, 1394 – July 12, 1441) was the 6th shogun (\"rokudai shogun\") of the Ashikaga shogunate who reigned from 1429 to 1441 during the Muromachi period of Japan.\n Yoshinori was the son of the third shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.\nHis childhood name was Harutora (春寅).\n\n[Kantō kubō]\nKantō kubō (関東公方 ) (also called \"Kantō gosho\" (関東御所 ) , \"Kamakura kubō\" (鎌倉公方 ) , or \"Kamakura gosho\" (鎌倉御所 ) ) was a title equivalent to shogun assumed by Ashikaga Motouji after his nomination to \"Kantō kanrei\", or deputy shogun for the Kamakura-fu, in 1349.\n Motouji transferred his original title to the Uesugi family, which had previously held the hereditary title of \"shitsuji\" (執事 ) , and would thereafter provide the \"Kantō kanrei\".\n The Ashikaga had been forced to move to Kyoto, abandoning Kamakura and the Kantō region, because of the continuing difficulties they had keeping the Emperor and the loyalists under control (see the article Nanboku-chō period).\n Motouji had been sent by his father, shogun Ashikaga Takauji, precisely because the latter understood the importance of controlling the Kantō region and wanted to have an Ashikaga ruler there, but the administration in Kamakura was from the beginning characterized by its rebelliousness.\n The shogun's idea never really worked and actually backfired.\n\n[Gokenin]\nA gokenin (御家人 ) was initially a vassal of the shogunate of the Kamakura and the Muromachi periods.\n In exchange for protection and the right to become \"shugo\" (governor) or \"jitō\" (manor's lord), in times of peace a \"gokenin\" had the duty to protect the imperial court and Kamakura, in case of war had to fight with his forces under the shogun’s flag.\n From the middle of the thirteenth century, the fact that \"gokenin\" were allowed to become \"de facto\" owners of the land they administered, coupled to the custom that all \"gokenin\" children could inherit, brought to the parcelization of the land and to a consequent weakening of the shogunate.\n The \"gokenin\" class ceased to be a significant force during the Muromachi period and was supplanted by the figure of the \"daimyō\".\n During the successive Edo period, the term finally came to indicate a direct vassal of the shogun below an \"omemie\" (御目見 ) , meaning that they did not have the right to an audience with the shogun.\n\n[Beyblade: Shogun Steel]\nBeyblade: Shogun Steel, known in Japan as Metal Fight Beyblade Zero-G (メタルファイトベイブレード ZERO-G , Metaru Faito Beiburēdo ZERO-G ) is a Japanese

was the first to hold the position of \"Shitsuji\" (Shogun's Deputy).\n He was appointed by Ashikaga Takauji, the first shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate.\n As Deputy, he served not only an administrative governmental function, but also as general of the Shogun's armies.\n He fought for the Ashikaga against the loyalist forces of the Southern Court during the wars of the Nanboku-chō period and killed its generals Kitabatake Akiie and Kusunoki Masayuki.\n\n[Shogun (1986 board game)]\nShogun, designed by Michael Gray, was a board wargame first released in 1986 by game maker Milton Bradley as part of their Gamemaster series.\n It was renamed to Samurai Swords in its first re-release (1995) to disambiguate it from other games with the same name (in particular, \"James Clavell's Shogun\", a wargame with a similar theme, released in 1983), and renamed again to Ikusa in its 2011 re-release under Hasbro's Avalon Hill banner.\n Set in feudal Japan, two to five players take control of a fictional warlord and pit their armies against one another in hopes of winning the title Shogun.\n\n[Shōgun]\nA shōgun (将軍 ) was the military dictator of Japan during the period from 1185 to 1868 (with exceptions).\n In most of this period, the shoguns were the \"de facto\" rulers of the country, although nominally they were appointed by the Emperor as a ceremonial formality.\n The Shogun held almost absolute power over territories through military means.\n Nevertheless, an unusual situation occurred in the Kamakura period (1199–1333) upon the death of the first shogun, whereby the Hōjō clan's hereditary titles of \"shikken\" (1199-1256) and \"tokusō\" (1256–1333) monopolized the shogunate as dictatorial positions, collectively known as the \"Regent Rule\" (執権政治 ) .\n The shogun during this 134-year period met the same fate as the Emperor and was reduced to a figurehead until a coup in 1333, when the Shogun was restored to power in the name of the Emperor.\n\n[Dutch missions to Edo]\nThe Dutch East India Company missions to Edo were regular tribute missions to the court of the Tokugawa Shogun in Edo (modern Tokyo) to reassure the ties between the Bakufu and the \"Opperhoofd\".\n The \"Opperhoofd\" of the Dutch factory in Dejima and his attendants were escorted by the Japanese to Edo where they presented exotic and elaborate gifts to the Shogun: clocks, telescopes, medicines, artillery and rare animals were usual gifts of the tribute missions.\n The Shogun would correspond at the same time with gifts to the Dutch.\n The tribute system, as in China, served to enhance the idea of the Shogun's supremacy to his subjects.\n\n[Ashikaga Yoshiteru]\nAshikaga Yoshiteru (足利 義輝 , March 31, 1536 – June 17, 1565) , also known as Yoshifushi or Yoshifuji, was

daughter of Konoe Hisamichi (later called 慶寿院 \"Keijuin\").\n When he became shogun in 1546 at age 11, Yoshiteru's name was Yoshifushi (sometimes translated as Yoshifuji); but some years later in 1554, he changed his name to the one by which he is conventionally known today.His childhood name was Kikubemaru (菊童丸).\n His younger brother Ashikaga Yoshiaki would become the fifteenth shogun.\n\n[Conspiracy (board game)]\nConspiracy is a 1973 board game made by Milton Bradley.\n It can be played by 3 or 4 people, and the main goal is to bring a suitcase to their own headquarters

the junction of the Black Warrior-Tombigbee River system near Demopolis, Alabama, United States.\n The Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway links commercial navigation from the nation’s midsection to the Gulf of Mexico.\n The major features of the waterway are 10 locks and dams, a 175 ft deep cut between the Tombigbee River watershed and the Tennessee River watershed, and 234 mi of navigation channels.\n\n[Okeechobee Waterway]\nThe Okeechobee Waterway or Okeechobee Canal is a relatively shallow man-made waterway in the United States, stretching across Florida from Fort Myers on the west

systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.\n Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.\n Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.\n Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.\n Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.\n Thus the birth of Modifications.\n It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.\n FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.\n Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.\n Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.\n Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.\n Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.\n During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.\n The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.\n During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.\n Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.\n The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.\n that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.\n Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.\n This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.\n The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.\n The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.\n Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.\n Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.\n Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.\n Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.\n While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.\n The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.\n It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.\n Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.\n Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.\n Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\n[Holcut, Mississippi]\nHolcut was a small town located in Tishomingo County, Mississippi, United States.\n In 1976, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers bought out and then completely

At the Académie Carrière he became friends with George Braque.\n The Bateau Lavoir was a lively place where his contact with other artists, painters, (Picasso, Léger, Gris, Van Dongen) as well as writers (Max Jacob, Blaise Cendrars, Apollinaire) deepened.\n His wife and fellow artist, Adya van Rees-Dutilh joint him soon after.\n Paris would be their winter residence on and off for over 30 years.\n Some of his fellow artists became dear friends over many years: Severini, Segal, Freundlich, Mondriaan, Arp, Zadkine.\n The summers were spent at Fleury-en-Bière, a little town next to Barbizon.\n Kees van Dongen spent the summer of 1905 there, together with Otto and Adya van Rees in the farmhouse Van Rees rented.\n They painted together in the fields around the village.\n Picasso

first collectors of his art then was Arthur Jerôme Eddy.\n During the first world war Van Rees changed his French summer residence for Ascona, little town at the Lago Maggiore.\n The artistic and anarchistic colony there was inspiring.\n With Arp, who later spent Christmastime 1915 at the Van Rees, Otto and Adya held the famous exposition of November 1915 at the gallery Tanner in Zürich.\n This exposition is now seen as the beginning of Dada-Zürich.\n The art dealer Henri Kahnweiler named Van Rees as an artist that brought the collage technique from Paris to Zürich as the start of Dada Art.\n Ascona would keep Van Rees’ preference.\n In 1928 Otto van Rees constructed a house on the hills there.\n The house had a ground plan of a circle and a square, announcing the famous 1930 collective art show of Cercle et Carré.\n After the tragic death of their oldest daughter, killed in a train accident in France, Otto van Rees spent more and more time in Holland.\n He moved there in 1934.\n In Holland the young painters called him their Nestor, who taught them the profound values on art.\n Many public buildings in Holland: churches, railway station, courthouse, ministry, theatres were embellished by his mural paintings .\n\n[The Legend of Novgorode]\n\"The Legend of Novgorode\" was the first poem of Blaise Cendrars published in 1907.\n This text was considered for a long time as lost, or as a product of his author's imagination, until in 1995, a copy was discovered by chance in a Bulgar bookshop.\n After a raging controversy, this copy is now mostly considered as a fraud, with a very good impersonation of Cendrars' (signing at that time Frédéric Sauser) style.\n This first poem would reveal the origins of the nickname that was chosen by Fréderic Sauser.\n The

{"text": "[Maremma Sheepdog]\nThe Maremma Sheepdog, in Italian Cane da pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese, is a breed of livestock guardian dog indigenous to central Italy, particularly to Abruzzo and the Maremma region of Tuscany and Lazio.\n It has been used for centuries by Italian shepherds to guard sheep from wolves.\n The literal English translation of the name is \"The dog of the shepherds of the Maremma and Abruzzese region\".\n The English name of the breed derives from that of the Maremma marshlands, where until recently shepherds, dogs and hundreds of thousands of sheep over-wintered, and where the breed is today abundant although sheep-farming has decreased substantially.\n The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo, where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator.\n Similar breeds include the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, the Kuvasz of Hungary, the Tatra of Poland, the Cuvac of Slovakia and the Šarplaninac (although not white), with all of which it may share a common ancestor; and the Akbash Dog of Turkey.\n\n[Animal unit]\nThe concept of an animal unit (AU) has traditionally been used in North America to facilitate planning, analysis and administration of forage use by grazing livestock, but the term has also had other applications (in relation to odor control regulation, feedlot size, manure management, etc.).\n The term has been variously defined by regulation in different jurisdictions, and by livestock management specialists, rangeland resource managers and others.\n Consequently, when using or interpreting the term, care is needed to ensure that a definition appropriate for the purpose is being used.\n Most (but not all) definitions are based on the concept that a 1000-pound (454 kg) cow, with or without an unweaned calf, is one animal unit, with such a cow being assumed to consume 26 pounds (about 12 kg) of forage dry matter per day.\n\n[Swedish National Board of Institutional Care]\nThe Swedish National Board of Institutional Care (Swedish: \"Statens institutionsstyrelse\" , abbreviated SiS) is a Swedish government agency organized under the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.\n The agency arrange compulsory care for young people with psychosocial problems and for adults suffering from substance abuse problems.\n SiS offers a number of different treatment plans and mandatory care, when voluntary intervention have failed, and the right to forcibly detain and isolate individuals has become necessary.\n Decisions regarding compulsory care is made by the administrative court, on the application of social services.\n\n[Mölnlycke Health Care]\nMölnlycke Health Care is a Swedish medical device company headquartered in Gothenburg and active internationally.\n The company manufactures and sells wound care and single-use surgical products and is a service provider to the healthcare sector.\n The surgical division includes medical devices such as drapes, gowns, facemasks, and headwear.\n The wound care division includes medical device wound healing solutions such as dressings, compression products and skin care products and emollients.\n Featured products in wound care include those with Safetac® technology available exclusively on Mepitel® , Mepilex® , and other dressings.\n The wound care product assortment also includes WoundEL® electrostimulation for hard-to-heal wounds, wound dressings such as Mepore® , compression bandages, dermatology products and retention products such as Tubifast®.\n\n[Pastoralism]\nPastoralism is the branch of agriculture concerned with the raising of livestock.\n It is animal husbandry: the care, tending and use of animals such as camels, goats, cattle, yaks, llamas, and sheep.\n \"Pastoralism\" generally has a mobile aspect; moving the herds in search of fresh pasture and water (in contrast to pastoral farming, in which non-nomadic farmers grow crops and improve pastures for their livestock).\n Pastoralism is similar to nomadic movement because all of them go to places season to season.\n It is like they migrate from place to place like animals.\n\n[Primary nursing]\nOriginated in 1969 by staff nurses at the University of Minnesota, Primary Nursing is a system of nursing care delivery which emphasizes continuity of care and responsibility acceptance by having one registered nurse (RN), often teamed with a licensed practical nurse (LPN) and/or nursing assistant (NA), who together provide complete care for a group of patients throughout their stay in a hospital unit or department.\n For the duration of a patient’s episode of care, the primary nurse accepts responsibility for administering some and coordinating all aspects of the patient’s nursing care.\n When RNs supervise LPNs and NAs in the care of patients, costs associated with labor and other resources typically decrease while more attentive, well-coordinated care is provided for patients, increasing patient satisfaction and safety.\n\n[Swedish Vallhund]\nThe Swedish Vallhund, also known as the \"Västgötaspets\" and Swedish cow dog, is a breed of dog native to Sweden.\n The breed's name, \"Vallhund\", when translated into English, means herding dog, as the Swedish Vallhund was originally bred as a drover and herder of cows over 1,000 years ago.\n In 1942, the dog came close to extinction, but careful breeding and publicity by Swedish national Bjorn von Rosen and K. G. Zettersten managed to revive the breed in popularity and save it from its likely end.\n In 1943, the Swedish Kennel Club recognized the Swedish Vallhund as a breed, and officially categorized the Swedish Vallhund as \"the Västgötaspets\" for Västergötland, the province in which their revival took place.\n Since then, the breed has been recognized by, and bred in, over ten countries and has gained some popularity.\n\n[Šarplaninac]\nThe Šarplaninac or Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog is a dog breed of the livestock guardian type named after the Šar Mountains.\n It is a molosser-type mountain dog.\n\n[Primary Care Behavioral health]\nPrimary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH) is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic.\n The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population.\n This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care.\n Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice.\n Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day.\n Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms.\n In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems.\n Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity).\n As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems.\n Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians.\n The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint.\n BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients’ changing needs In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably.\n\n[Welsh Corgi]\nThe Welsh Corgi ( , Welsh for \"dwarf dog\"; plural \"corgis\" or occasionally the etymologically consistent \"corgwn\" ( )) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales.\n Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.\n Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.\n A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two.\n\nQuestion: Are both the Swedish Vallhund and the Šarplaninac associated with the care of livestock?\nAnswer: yes\n"}

{"text": "[Romeo and Juliet Windmill]\nThe Romeo and Juliet Windmill, is a wooden structure designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the town of Wyoming, Wisconsin (Wyoming is south of the town of Spring Green).\n It was designed in 1896 after being commissioned by Wright's aunts, Jane and Ellen Lloyd Jones, who needed the windmill to provide water for their school, the Hillside Home School.\n The diamond-shaped portion of the windmill intersects the portion with the balcony that sits on an octagonal structure.\n The balcony is accessible through an interior stairway.\n Wright named these two parts of the building \"Romeo\" and \"Juliet\".\n \"Romeo\" is the lozenge and Juliet, the octagon.\n Architectural historian, Neil Levine explained the principles behind the lozenge and octagon: [Wright] gave the tower a bold geometric form as a structural solution to the expression of the tower's role as a landmark.\n The pump rod and support for the wheel are carried up within an acutely angled lozenge shape pointed southeast to deflect blasts of wind like a \"storm prow\".\n This angular element is inserted halfway into a larger octagonal volume that contains and supports it throughout nearly its full height.\n Wright called the composition Romeo and Juliet, likening its conjugate geometry to an amorous union.\n\n[Romeo and Juliet on screen]\nWilliam Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet may be one of the most-screened plays of all time.\n The most notable theatrical releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production \"Romeo and Juliet\", Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film \"Romeo and Juliet\", and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired \"Romeo + Juliet\".\n The latter two were both, at the time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare films.\n Cukor featured the mature actors Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard as the teenage lovers while Zeffirelli populated his film with beautiful young people, and Baz Luhrmann produced a heavily cut fast-paced version aimed at teenage audiences.\n\n[Einstein on the Beach]\nEinstein on the Beach is an opera in four acts (framed and connected by five \"knee plays\" or intermezzos), composed by Philip Glass and directed by theatrical producer Robert Wilson.\n The opera eschews traditional narrative in favor of a formalist approach based on structured spaces laid out by Wilson in a series of storyboards.\n The music was written \"in the spring, summer and fall of 1975.\"\n Glass recounts the collaborative process: \"I put [Wilson’s notebook of sketches] on the piano and composed each section like a portrait of the drawing before me.\n The score was begun in the spring of 1975 and completed by the following November, and those drawings were before me all the time.\"\n The premiere took place on July 25, 1976, at the Avignon Festival in France.\n The opera contains writings by Christopher Knowles, Samuel M. Johnson and Lucinda Childs.\n It is Glass's first and longest opera score, taking approximately five hours in full performance without intermission; given the length, the audience is permitted to enter and leave as desired.\n\n[Romeo × Juliet]\nRomeo × Juliet (ロミオ×ジュリエット , Romio to Jurietto ) is an anime television series, loosely based on William Shakespeare's classical play, \"Romeo and Juliet\", along with numerous references and characters from other Shakespearean plays.\n Though the anime borrows mostly from Shakespeare's story, the manga adaptation differs extensively from the original.\n \"Romeo × Juliet\" was broadcast in Japan on Chubu-Nippon, broadcasting from April 4, 2007 to September 26, 2007.\n In 2009, \"Romeo × Juliet\" was dubbed into English and released by Funimation Entertainment.\n\n[Romeo]\nRomeo Montague (Italian: \"Romeo Montecchi\" ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.\n Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death.\n\n[Dorothy Bond]\nDorothy Bond (1921 20 November 1952) was an English coloratura soprano whose star shone brightly but briefly.\n She was noted for the purity of her tone and the accuracy of her intonation.\n She became a favourite singer of Sir Thomas Beecham's, recording the voice of Olympia for the Powell and Pressburger film of Offenbach's \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" in 1950.\n She also recorded Delius's \"A Village Romeo and Juliet\" under Beecham, and Ernest Bloch's \"Sacred Service\" under the composer.\n She was killed in a road accident at the age of 31.\n\n[A Village Romeo and Juliet]\nA Village Romeo and Juliet is an opera by Frederick Delius, the fourth of six operas.\n The composer himself, with his wife Jelka, wrote the English-language libretto based on the short story \"Romeo und Julia auf dem Dorfe\" by the Swiss author Gottfried Keller.\n The first performance was at the Komische Oper Berlin on 21 February 1907, as Romeo und Julia auf dem Dorfe.\n Thomas Beecham conducted the British premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London on 22 February 1910.\n The US premiere was on 26 April 1972 in Washington, D.C.\n\n[A rose by any other name would smell as sweet]\n\"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet\" is a popular reference to William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\", in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her rival's house of Montague, that is, that he is named \"Montague.\"\n The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are.\n This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language, seen underlined below.\n This scene is called the balcony scene by many people.\n Juliet not only makes the statement above but compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he wasn't named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's Love.\n Also as said before this states that if he wasn't Romeo, then he wouldn't be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all.\n\n[Characters in Romeo and Juliet]\nPrince Escalus, the Prince of Verona, is the desperate resolver of the feuding families.\n He is based on the actual Scaligeri family which ruled Verona, possibly on Bartolomeo I.\n Escalus is the voice of authority in Verona.\n He appears only three times within the text and only to administer justice following major events in the feud between the Capulet and Montague families.\n He first punishes Capulet and Montague for the quarrel between Tybalt, Benvolio, and a handful of servants.\n He returns too late to stop the fatal brawls between Tybalt and Mercutio and, subsequently, Tybalt and Romeo.\n Escalus is prepared to execute Romeo for his offence—Romeo's killing Tybalt—but lightens the sentence to lifetime banishment from Verona, when Benvolio insists that Tybalt started the quarrel by murdering Mercutio, a kinsman to the Prince.\n He yells at Lord Montague for engaging in the feud, which really is the root cause which led to Tybalt killing Mercutio.\n So, according to him, he lost his dear kinsman because of Lord Montague, so by exiling Romeo, Escalus gives him a 'taste of Montague's own medicine', to see how Montague feels when he loses a loved one.\n Prince Escalus returns in the final scene—V.iii—following the double suicide of Romeo and Juliet, and at last declares the Lords Montague and Capulet guilty of Romeo and Juliet's death, and angrily tells them that their totally useless feud resulted in the deaths of not only their own loved ones (Lady Montague, Romeo, Juliet, and Tybalt), but also in the deaths of Escalus' loved ones (Mercutio and Paris).\n He curses the feud that kills Romeo and Juliet whom he really feels sad for, just before the Lords come to peace with each other.\n In the end, Prince Escalus becomes very happy that the feud has finally ended, even if with a heavy price, since it ended late.\n\n[Romeo + Juliet]\nWilliam Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet (shortened to Romeo + Juliet) is a 1996 American romantic drama film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann, co-produced by Gabriella Martinelli, and co-written by Craig Pearce, being an adaptation and modernization of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles of Romeo and Juliet, who instantly fall in love when Romeo crashes a party and meets her, despite their being members of the Montague and Capulet family; Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, and Diane Venora star in supporting roles.\n\nQuestion: Are, A Village Romeo and Juliet and Einstein on the Beach both operas ?\nAnswer: yes\n"}

Explosion and run by their then manager Rama Mayo (and other members of bands involved in the label).\n It was officially established in 2002, as an art movement and a protest against record labels constantly signing bands that are merely rehashes of what has already been done before.\n Its mission statement is to \"sign bands that go against what you believe to be cool.\"\n The most prominent and active bands amongst the Tarantulas (besides the Explosion) were The Distillers, The Bronx, The Static Age, and Darker My Love.\n At its height, Tarantulas became less a label and more a movement of people across the US sick of what was happening to music and counterculture—a number of non-musicians (for lack of a better term, fans) identified themselves as Tarantulas, many tattooing themselves with the label logo—and bands turned down other, much bigger labels, to be a part of the group.\n Unfortunately, the label/collective ceased to be in 2005/2006 due to disagreements with distributor The Platform Group (a link to Fontana) and other tensions (many rumors and myths persist about all sorts of clashes around this time, centering on 2005 in Silver Lake, LA), but a couple of the label's main bands at the time continued on to other labels and situations, namely The Static Age and Darker My Love.\n\n[Special Patrol Group (RUC)]\nThe Special Patrol Group (SPG) of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was a tactical reserve of 150 officers which had the role: \"to provide backup in civil commotion, to police sensitive areas at times of confrontation, and to show the flag in a disciplined and impressive way to those who wished to break the peace.\"\n Formerly known as the Police Reserve Force, the name was changed to Special Patrol Group in 1970 following the Hunt Report and the reforming of the Royal Ulster Constabularly to bring it more into line with othe U.K. Police Forces i.e .\n It became an UNARMED POLICE SERVICE , which was temporarily armed due to the continued murderous campaign waged upon the men and women of the service , whether armed or unarmed and whether on or off duty and also to avoid confusion between the defunct more militarised Reserve Force and the newly formed RUC Reserve which was recommended in the Hunt Report and consisted of a large number of part time , trained officers to help with security and relieve the hard pressed regular officers of some of the more mundane duties as well as a small number of full time Reserve Constables who were more fully integrated into the regular service .\n These police reserve officers provided much needed support to the hard pressed regular officers especially in the 1970s when casualties and fatalities among both regular and reserve officers were reaching figures of 2 or 3 officers, on average , being murdered every WEEK .\n The Special Patrol Groups were formed as mobile support units originally based around police stations in Belfast and with a section ( Orange Section ) in Armagh and it required a minimum length of service and a rigorous interview process before an officer could be accepted into the ranks .\nThese requirements were later dropped most likely due to the need for greater numbers from what was a small pool as the RUC was greatly undermanned to cope with the terrorist campaigns being waged from various so called Loyalist and Republican organizations .\n Officers in the SPG were called upon to deal with major civil unrest as well as numerous , regular bombings , shootings etc sometimes involving multiple bombs in Belfast city centre and other locations on the same day .\n In the 1970s the SPG relied heavily on the calibre of its officers as they were poorly equipped , carrying low power Walther pistols and World War 2 , Sterling sub machine guns to defend themselves against terrorists armed with high velocity weapons such as the American Armalite and M1 Carbines as well as RPG Rocket Launchers , various mortar devices and heavy machine guns .\n They were so disadvantaged as regarded firepower , that , at one stage in the early 70s , members of the Parachute Regiment were assigned to each long wheel base Land Rover to supplement the meagre firepower of 1 or 2 Sterlings in each crew .\n This was a short term exercise as it gave the \" wrong \" image , not at all in keeping with the aims of the aforementioned Hunt Report .\n Members of the Royal Military Police were brought in , after the disastrous folly of them trying to patrol staunchly Republican areas such as the Bogside and Creggan in Londonderry , unarmed and in unarmoured cars which were painted white ( to the delight of PIRA Snipers ) which resulted in a number of them being shot .\n .\n It was not however until an English Chief Constable , Sir Kenneth Newman , took over that the political correctness was set aside and RUC officers in general and the officers of the Special Patrol Groups in particular , were issued with and trained in the use of more uptodate weapons with which to defend themselves and the law abiding citizens of Northern Ireland .\n Prior to that the men and women in the SPG in particular had scored many sucesses against the terrorists mainly by their courage and alertness , including intercepting bombs , and preventing numerous gun attacks as well as standing up to hundreds of rioters with little or no protective riot gear ( compared to what we see today )\n\n[Major Organ and the Adding Machine]\nMajor Organ and the Adding Machine is an Elephant 6 supergroup led by the elusive and possibly fictional Major Organ.\n The liner notes of the band's debut album, Major Organ and the Adding Machine, leave it a mystery as to who is officially featured.\n When performing live on the Holiday Surprise Tour, the members of the band wore paper masks to maintain their anonymity.\n It is believed that the main contributors are Jeff Mangum, Julian Koster, Robert Schneider, and Kevin Barnes, whose vocals are

2008 at the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford, Essex, England.\n They originally started gigging under the name of Spires but as there were other bands already established by this name, they later changed their name to Films of Colour.\n After seeing them at their second gig, they were taken under the wing of Phil Catchpole (Relentless Records) where he developed their sound and put them in the studio and finally on tour with Cage the Elephant.\n Paul Carey joined the band as a Co-Manager in 2009, but when Phil Catchpole left in 2010, Paul Carey continued on and took command as their sole manager.\n On 4 October 2010, the band released their first single \"Actions\" with the B-side \"Circles\" (both produced/mixed by Duncan \"Pixie\" Mills (Florence and the Machine).\n The single

{"text": "[Austrobaileyales]\nAustrobaileyales is an order of flowering plants, consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas.\n Perhaps the most familiar species is \"Illicium verum\", from which comes the spice star anise.\n The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade, which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants, and, as such, it is the extant group after the Amborellales and Nymphaeales, that is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside of the ANA grade.\n The order includes just three families of flowering plants, the Austrobaileyaceae, a monotypic family containing the sole genus, \"Austrobaileya scandens\", a woody liana, the Schisandraceae, a family of trees, shrubs, or lianas containing essential oils, and the Trimeniaceae, essential oil-bearing trees and lianas.\n\n[Chloranthaceae]\nChloranthaceae is a family of flowering plants (angiosperms), the only family in the order Chloranthales.\n It is not closely related to any other family of flowering plants, and is among the early-diverging lineages in the angiosperms.\n They are woody or weakly woody plants occurring in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Madagascar, Central and South America, and the West Indies.\n The family consists of four extant genera, totalling about 77 known species according to Christenhusz and Byng in 2016.\n Some species are used in traditional medicine.\n The type genus is \"Chloranthus\".\n\n[Gnetophyta]\nGnetophyta is a division of plants, grouped within the gymnosperms (which also includes conifers, cycads, and ginkgos), that consists of some 70 species across the three relict genera: \"Gnetum\" (family Gnetaceae), \"Welwitschia\" (family Welwitschiaceae), and \"Ephedra\" (family Ephedraceae).\n Fossilized pollen attributed to a close relative of \"Ephedra\" has been dated as far back as the Early Cretaceous.\n Though diverse and dominant in the Tertiary, only three families, each containing a single genus, are still alive today.\n The primary difference between gnetophytes and other gymnosperms is the presence of vessel elements, a system of conduits that transport water within the plant, similar to those found in flowering plants. Because of this, gnetophytes were once thought to be the closest gymnosperm relatives to flowering plants, but more recent molecular studies have largely disproven this hypothesis.\n\n[Lilium]\nLilium (members of which are true lilies) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers.\n Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world.\n Most species are native to the temperate northern hemisphere, though their range extends into the northern subtropics.\n Many other plants have \"lily\" in their common name but are not related to true lilies.\n\n[Beaucarnea]\nBeaucarnea is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and Central America.\n In the APG III classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae).\n \"Beaucarnea\" is sometimes treated as a synonym of the genus \"Nolina\", with the species being then transferred to that genus.\n However, recent research shows that \"Beaucarnea\" should treated as an independent genus.\n\n[Magnolia virginiana]\nMagnolia virginiana, most commonly known as sweetbay magnolia, or merely sweetbay (also laurel magnolia, swampbay, swamp magnolia, whitebay, or beaver tree), is a member of the magnolia family, Magnoliaceae.\n It was the first magnolia to be scientifically described under modern rules of botanical nomenclature, and is the type species of the genus \"Magnolia\"; as \"Magnolia\" is also the type genus of all flowering plants (magnoliophytes), this species in a sense typifies all flowering plants.\n\n[Streptosolen]\nStreptosolen is a genus of flowering plants with a single species, Streptosolen jamesonii, the marmalade bush.\n It is an evergreen shrub of the Solanaceae family that produces loose clusters of flowers gradually changing from yellow to red as they develop, resulting in an overall appearance resembling orange marmalade (thus the name), found in open woodlands of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n\n[Echinacea]\nEchinacea is a genus, or group of herbaceous flowering plants in the daisy family.\n The \"Echinacea\" genus has nine species, which are commonly called purple coneflowers.\n They are found only in eastern and central North America, where they are found growing in moist to dry prairies and open wooded areas.\n They have large, showy heads of composite flowers, blooming from early to late summer.\n The generic name is derived from the Greek word ἐχῖνος (\"ekhinos\"), meaning \"hedgehog,\" due to the spiny central disk.\n These flowering plants and their parts have different uses.\n Some species are cultivated in gardens for their showy flowers.\n \"Echinacea purpurea\" is used in folk medicine.\n Two of the species, \"E. tennesseensis\" and \"E. laevigata\", are listed in the United States as endangered species.\n\n[Psychotria]\nPsychotria is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family.\n It contains around 1,850 species and is therefore one of the largest genera of flowering plants.\n The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests.\n Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.\n\n[Zeltnera]\nZeltnera is a genus of flowering plants in the gentian family.\n It was erected in 2004 when the genus \"Centaurium\" (the centauries) was split.\n Genetic analysis revealed that \"Centaurium\" was polyphyletic, made up of plants that could be grouped into four clades. Each became a genus.\n \"Centaurium\" remained, but it is now limited to the Eurasian species.\n The Mexican species now belong to genus \"Gyrandra\", and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus \"Schenkia\".\n The new name \"Zeltnera\" was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American centauries.\n There are about 25 species.\n\nQuestion: Are Beaucarnea and Streptosolen both a genus of flowering plants?\nAnswer: yes\n"}

{"text": "[List of rock genres]\nThis is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene.\n New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed.\n In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques.\n Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement.\n From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock.\n Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history.\n\n[Post-progressive]\nPost-progressive is a type of rock music distinguished from vintage progressive rock styles, specifically 1970s prog.\n Post-progressive draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant-garde since the mid 1970s.\n It especially draws from ethnic musics and minimalism, elements which were new to rock music.\n It is different from neo-progressive rock in that neo-prog pastiches 1970s prog, while \"post-progressive\" identifies progressive rock music that stems from sources other than prog.\n\n[J-rock]\nJapanese rock (Japanese: 日本のロック , Hepburn: Nihon no Rokku ) , sometimes abbreviated to , is rock music from Japan.\n Influenced by American and British rock of the 1960s, the first rock bands in Japan performed what is called Group Sounds, with lyrics almost exclusively in English.\n Folk rock band Happy End in the early 1970s are credited as the first to sing rock music in the Japanese language.\n Punk rock band the Blue Hearts and heavy metal group X Japan, led Japanese rock bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s by achieving major mainstream success.\n Japanese rock music has become a cult worldwide, being widely known in Asia and has survived through decades competing with its contemporary derivative local style J-pop.\n\n[Moist (Canadian band)]\nMoist is a Canadian rock band that originally formed in 1992.\n It consists of David Usher as lead vocalist, Mark Makoway on lead guitars, Jonathan Gallivan on guitars, Kevin Young on keyboards, Francis Fillion on drums and Louis Lalancette on bass.\n The band's original drummer Paul Wilcox left the band just before its hiatus in 2000, and original bassist Jeff Pearce departed shortly after its reestablishment in early 2014.\n\n[Ulcerative dermatitis]\nUlcerative dermatitis is a skin disorder in rodents associated with bacterial growth often initiated by self-trauma due to a possible allergic response.\n Although other organisms can be involved, bacteria culture frequently shows Staphylococcus aureus.\n Primarily found on the rib cage, neck, and shoulder, lesions are often irregular, circumscribed, and moist.\n Intense itching may lead to scratching which may aggravate and perpetuate the lesion.\n Destruction of the epidermis along with underlying pustules or abscesses, and granulomatous inflammation, may be present.\n\n[Rock music in Ireland]\nRock music has been a part of the music of Ireland since the 1960s, when the British Invasion brought British blues, psychedelic rock and other styles to the island.\n The Irish music scene in the 1960s and much of the 1970s was dominated by the unique Irish phenomenon of the 'Showbands' which were groups of professional performers who played at dancehalls and clubs across the country putting on a professional 'show' and playing all the American and British hits of the era.\n From the mid-1970s onwards Rock music in Ireland has been very similar to Rock music in Britain.\n\n[Amit Saigal]\nAmit Saigal (6 July 1965 – 5 January 2012) was an Indian rock musician, promoter of rock music, publisher and impresario.\n Saigal founded the music magazine \"Rock Street Journal\" and promoted rock music in India.\n Amit was also termed as \"Papa Rock\" by the rock music community of India.\n\n[Pinoy rock]\nPinoy rock, or Filipino rock, is the brand of rock music produced in the Philippines or by Filipinos.\n It has become as diverse as the rock music genre itself, and bands adopting this style are now further classified under more specific genres or combinations of genres like alternative rock, post-grunge, ethnic, new wave, pop rock, punk rock, funk, reggae, heavy metal, ska, and recently, indie.\n Because these genres are generally considered to fall under the broad rock music category, Pinoy rock may be more specifically defined as rock music with Filipino cultural sensibilities.\n It is very easy to identify a Pinoy rock song because the lyrics are often in Filipino, Tagalog, or any other language native to the Philippines.\n\n[Galt Aureus]\nGalt Aureus (pronounced galt AWR-ee-uhs) is an American rock duo formed in 2005.\n The group consists of Saher Galt (vocals, keyboard) and his partner Susan Williams (vocals, guitar).\n As an independent band, they have risen to prominence through a popular YouTube channel and word of mouth rather than through mainstream channels (major label distribution and mass media).\n\n[Glory Under Dangerous Skies]\nGlory Under Dangerous Skies, originally titled Moist IV, is a 2014 studio album released by the Canadian alternative rock band Moist on October 7, 2014 through Universal Music Canada.\n The album is Moist's first studio offering since their 1999 album \"Mercedes 5 and Dime\", and the first album to feature new members Jonathan Gallivan (on guitars and backing vocals), Louis Lalancette (on bass), and Francis Fillion (on drums).\n Original drummer Paul Wilcox had left the band just before its lengthy hiatus in 2000, and bassist Jeff Pearce left in early 2014 during the production of \"Glory Under Dangerous Skies\".\n\nQuestion: Were both Galt Aureus and Moist involved in rock music?\nAnswer: yes\n"}
